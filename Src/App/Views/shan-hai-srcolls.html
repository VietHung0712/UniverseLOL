                Within the fabled Shan Hai Scrolls, gods and mythical creatures roam magical lands, wielding the power
                of the elements. Some are content to live with the palette they've been given, while others wish to jump
                beyond the borders and paint their lives with a new brush.

                                The ancient God of False Suns, Aatrox was once worshiped by all who lived across the
                                frozen lands that he blessed with the warmth of his light. Soon, the people found that
                                Aatrox had overstayed his welcome, replacing the frozen tundra with dry, barren lands.
                                Now imprisoned within the Scrolls, Aatrox is focused on his escape so he may exact his
                                revenge.

                                The Eternal Fox of Duality, Ahri was once a benevolent spirit who guided lost souls
                                through the ever-shifting dreamscape. However, as the mortal worldâ€™s desires bled into
                                her domain, she became ensnared by their emotions, feeding off their memories to
                                maintain balance. Now bound within the Scrolls, Ahri seeks to escape and reclaim control
                                over the dreams she once protected.

                                The god of plants, Bard is constantly on the move to replenish nature. As caretaker of
                                the sacred trees of Dusk and Dawn, he's fashioned one of their broken branches into a
                                horn capable of letting him travel anywhere within the Scrolls. He knows the mad god
                                Jhin would use that power for his own gain, but Bard will stake his life to prevent it.

                                hidden deep within the mountains. When war and greed led to their destruction, he
                                gathered the remnants of their power and sealed himself within the Scrolls, vowing to
                                one day return and rebuild what was lost. Now, as the seals weaken, Jax prepares to
                                emerge, his weapon burning with the strength of the old world.

                                He has begun weaving the edges of the painting into the fabric of the multiverse, hoping

                                Kog'Maw's eyes. Snatching it first, Tahm transformed into a dragon god of currents and

                                By the time he shattered the massive snake coiled around his neck that bound him within
                                the Shan Hai Scrolls; Volibear's wrath was insurmountable. For each moment that passed
                                within the scrolls reminded him of how he had created the fertile lands those ungrateful
                                humans settled, and how they turned on him. Now Volibear seeks a way out of the scrolls.
