                <p>K/DA exploded into the music scene with their hit song “POP/STARS.” Fans of K/DA can’t get <br>enough
                    of their unconventional flair, from the trademark tails (which fans suspect are real)<br> to
                    otherworldly decor in their studio. “Our songs are for you to remember-always be true <br>to
                    yourself,” says lead singer Ahri. K/DA hopes to take their music around the world in a <br>global
                    tour.</p>
